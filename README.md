## Project Description
Trafalgar is a responsive landing page designed for a healthcare service provider.

## Key Features

## Future Improvements
- Add interactivity using JavaScript (e.g., for the testimonials carousel).
- Include animations for smoother transitions and better user engagement.
- Integrate a backend to make the "Consult Today" and "Download" buttons functional.
